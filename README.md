# MakeRetroGames game

This is a game created with MakeRetroGames! MakeRetroGames is an interactive game creation tool that helps
you build your own game, with source. 

The tool is currently in a closed alpha test - if you're interested, please send an email
to admin@cpprograms.net. 

ps: If you'd like to use this without the tool, go for it. However, I would strongly 
suggest considering 
[nes-starter-kit](https://nes-starter-kit.nes.science/) instead. It has a
guide on how to make all sorts of changes, and much less editor quirkiness.
